Wine Quality: Predicting Ratings Using Supervised Learning Techniques

# Introduction
The quality of wine is of utmost importance to consumers, producers and marketers alike, which makes this project rather valuable. The goal of this project is to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties like alcohol content, pH levels, acidity and many more. This prediction is done by employing supervised learning techniques namely, LASSO Regression and Random Forest, while using Linear Regression as a base model for the purpose of comparison.

# The Dataset
The data sets being used can be accessed at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality ). The dataset contains 12 variables that were recorded for 1,599 observations of red wine and 4,898 observations of white wine. Using this data, regression and random forest models were built to predict the impact of predictor variables on the target variable that is quality. If applied to real life situations, this analysis can help producers and businesses come up with informed business strategies to increase sales.
